demo_02,"A Comprehensive Examination of Student Unrest at Buffalo State College, 1966-1970",Lynn M. Lombardo,2011,"The student protests of the late 1960s and early 1970s were the most widespread in American history. Towards the end of the 1960s student protest tactics shifted from relatively peaceful rallies and sit-ins to more radical tactics, often involving disruption, property destruction and violence. Similar to many other campuses across the county, Buffalo State also experienced incidents of student protest in the late 1960s and early 1970s. There were protests that took action against what the protestors viewed as the administration's repressive practices and policies. There were controversies surrounding student rights, representation and code of conduct. The students of Buffalo State College went through the same cultural, political and generational changes that caused rallies and protests on other campuses around the country. The present study is a historical analysis of campus unrest at Buffalo State College between 1966 and 1970. This historical analysis examines the incidents of student protest at Buffalo State and the institutional role in responding to student unrest. The study is based on primary documents from Dr. Fretwell's administration, the student and local newspapers along with other materials collected in the Buffalo State library archives. A brief review of the history of American student activism places the case of Buffalo State into the larger national context of student protest in the United States during the 60s era.",Education; History,"Buffalo, NY",,,A Selection of Works on the History of Buffalo State College.
